Thank you for Purchasing Keynotopia prototyping templates!

What's included?
================
Every library contains the following files:

- template files for Keynote 09 (.key)
- theme files for keynote 09 (.kth)
and/or
- template files for PowerPoint (.ppt)


Installation
==============

Double click the .Key file to open it in Keynote or a .ppt file to open in PowerPoint

Working with library files
---------------------------
Keynotopia templates are used side-by-side with your target presentation, and they are ideal if you're working with dual monitors.
Open the .key/.ppt file, then create a new presentation and simply copy and paste interface elements onto your presentation. For Keynote, a .kth file also contains slide masters, which you can reveal from View menu -> Show Master slides.
