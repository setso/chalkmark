Welcome to the Janrain Engage library for the Android platform.  This library is available
open-source under a Berkeley license, as found in the LICENSE file.

What's new in Janrain Engage for Android 2.0:

- Tablet support:
  - Social sharing now runs either as an embedded Fragment or in a dialog
  - Authentication runs in a dialog
  - Support for Theme.Holo.Light, including appropriate themes for 'xlarge' screens
- Other new features:
  - Filtering the available social-sharing and authentication providers at run time
  - JRConnectionManager's networking layer now supports gzip compression for faster network operations
  - Eliminated Jackson JSON library dependency (~800k of redistributable overhead)
  - Sharing UI adjusts the display of its layout based on the available size (which can change based on the
    raised-state of the software keyboard.)
  - The ~Share button now remains visible above the keyboard when the keyboard is raised, but other UI
    elements disappear to accommodate the smaller available space.
- Bug fixes:
  - No more NullPointerExceptions from JRConnectionManager
  - User messages are now propagated to email/SMS intents the first time the button is pressed.
  - Switched from URLConnection to HttpClient to avoid intermittent network failures.
  - Multiple use auth_info tokens are no longer required.

In addition to new features and bug fixes, compatibility with Cupcake is dropped. (Engage for Android is now
compatible with Donut and above.)

Updating from 1.x to 2.0:

- Replace the activity declarations in your AndroidManifest.xml with fresh copies from
  JREngage/AndroidManifest.xml
- Update your Android target to Android 13 / Honeycomb 3.2 (still deployable to Android 4+ / Donut / 1.6)
  (Alternately, remove the "screenSize" configuration change handler from the "configChanges"
  portion of each JREngage Activity declaration in your AndroidManifest.xml and then target your app at
  lower versions of Android.)
- Ensure that the JREngage/libs/android-support-v4.jar is added to your IDE's project (ant builds work
  without updating)
- Ensure that the jackson-core-lgpl-1.6.4.jar and jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.6.4.jar libraries are removed from
  your IDE's project.

Using tablet support:
- Tablet support works in two modes, either embedded as a UI Fragment or as a modal dialog.
- To show a modal dialog simply continue to call JREngage#showAuthenticationDialog() or
  JREngage#showSocialPublishingDialog(...)
- To start a Fragment in a specific container call JREngage#showSocialPublishingFragment(...)
- Or, if you wish to manage the Fragment yourself (e.g. to add it to the back stack), use
  JREngage#createSocialPublishingFragment(...)
- Embedded mode requires a host activity sub-classed from android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity,
  android.app.FragmentActivity is incompatible.

Getting Started:

You will need git and the Android SDK with API level 13 (Android 3.2) or above. Project files are
maintained for IntelliJ.

First, download the SDK:
  git clone https://github.com/janrain/engage.android.git

Add your Engage App ID to the examples:
- engage.android/QuickShare/src/com/janrain/android/quickshare/QuickShareEnvironment.java
- engage.android/QuickShare/src/com/janrain/android/quicksignin/QuickSignInEnvironment.java
(Following the instructions in the comments.)

Compile with ant:
  $ cd engage.android/QuickShare
  $ android update project -p . -t android-13
  $ ant compile

Install with ant (adb must be running and an Android device or emulator must be available):
  $ ant install
