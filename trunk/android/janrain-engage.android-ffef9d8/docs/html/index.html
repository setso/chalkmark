With as few as three lines of code, you can authenticate your users with their accounts on Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, etc., and they can immediately publish their activities to multiple social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Yahoo, through one simple interface.</p>
<p>Beyond authentication and social sharing, the latest release of the Engage for Android SDK now allows mobile apps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share content, activities, game scores or invitations via Email or SMS</li>
<li>Track popularity and click through rates on various links included in the shared email message with automatic URL shortening for up to 5 URLs</li>
<li>Provide an additional level of security with forced re-authentication when users are about to make a purchase or conduct a sensitive transaction</li>
<li>Configure and maintain separate lists of providers for mobile and web apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin, you need to have created a <a href="https://rpxnow.com/signup_createapp_plus">Janrain Engage application</a>, which you can do on <a href="http://rpxnow.com">http://rpxnow.com</a></p>
<p>For an overview of how the library works and how you can take advantage of the library's features, please see the <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/android#user_experience">"Overview"</a> section of our documentation.</p>
<p>To begin using the SDK, please see the <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/android#quick">"Quick Start Guide"</a>.</p>
